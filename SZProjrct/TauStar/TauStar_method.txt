TauStar
Introduction
In this report, I also used PANSS and MCCB scale, and performed tests of independence by function tauStarTest in TauStar package (R package).
Procedure
Firstly, I used tauStarTest to calculated statistics and p value in both PANSS and MCCB. The result is named ¡°mccb (panss)_independance_statistic(pvalue)¡± and the code named ¡°TauStar.r¡± . And then, I draw heatmap with code named ¡°TauStarHeatmap.r¡± and result named ¡°MCCB (PANSS)_tStar_heatmap_1103.pdf¡±. In this code, p value < 0.05 is represented by ¡°+¡±, p value < 0.01 is represented by ¡°*¡±.
